# healthcare_worker_list_scraper

This script scrapes crowdsourced lists from around the world of healthcare workers who have died from COVID-19, and merges them into a single table with duplicates removed where matching is possible.

Some sources (i.e. Medscape) are scraped from live websites. The nurses.csv file was extracted using OCR from this National Nurses United report: https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/sites/default/files/nnu/graphics/documents/0920_Covid19_SinsOfOmission_Data_Report.pdf
