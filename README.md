# healthcare_worker_list_scraper

Scrape crowdsourced lists of healthcare workers who have died from COVID-19 and merge into a single table, clean and remove duplicates where possible.

Some sources (i.e. Medscape) are scraped from live websites. The nurses.csv file was extracted using OCR from this National Nurses United report: https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/sites/default/files/nnu/graphics/documents/0920_Covid19_SinsOfOmission_Data_Report.pdf
